We can use the `nth-of-type` selector to select ranges in a list of elements.

In the below example boxes 1-5 are blue, boxes 6-7 are green and boxes 8-12 are red.

<SelectingRangesWithNthOfType />

We can achieve this with the following CSS:

```css
.box {
  border: 4px solid red;
}

.box:nth-of-type(n + 1):nth-of-type(-1n + 5) {
  border-color: blue;
}

.box:nth-of-type(n + 6):nth-of-type(-1n + 7) {
  border-color: green;
}
```

### Explanation

The `nth-of-type` selector has an argument matching the pattern An+B where:

- A is an integer step size
- B is an integer offset
- n is all nonnegative integers, starting from 0

It can be read as the An+B-th element of a list.

Therefore:

```css
.box:nth-of-type(n + 1):nth-of-type(-1n + 5)
```

targets elements with the class `.box` based on their position among siblings of the same type (i.e., the same tag name) according to two criteria defined by the :nth-of-type pseudo-class:

- `nth-of-type(n + 1)`: This part selects every `.box` element from the first one onwards. The formula n + 1 starts counting at 1 (since n starts at 0), so it includes every element of this type.

- `nth-of-type(-1n + 5)`: This part selects `.box` elements counting backwards from the 5th one. The formula -1n + 5 effectively counts backward, selecting elements from the first through the fifth. For example, if there are 5 .box elements, this selector will match all of them. If there are 10, it will match the first 5.
