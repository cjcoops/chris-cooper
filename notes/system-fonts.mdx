- Loading Google Fonts will slow down your website
- Using system fonts means no font loading needs to occur and you already have access to all font-weights
- Note it will look different across different operation systems. https://github.com/system-fonts/modern-font-stacks shows what it looks like.

```css
font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;
```
